**Comments** : The Sprite class is concret class for all the game project to draw spring, it is enssential for 
			this project to work functionally, matthew did a great job to create a esily used Sprite design.

**Comments** : The coin barely does anything, and that is certainly shown in the code, it is
			   the length I expected it to be. The code was not complex and easy to read, if
			   there is a problem, it may have something to do with the sprite being public,
			   but I would not be sure yet, on whether this was for speed or this was something
			   for the long run as well, rest assured, it will be addressed sometime in the 
			   future.

				class design in this project.
