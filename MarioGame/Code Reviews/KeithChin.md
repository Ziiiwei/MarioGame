Minutes: 15

Naming : Very readable

- The variables used are context based, for example, marioCast is used in the MarioBlockTranslator
while goombaCast is used in the MarioGoombaTranslator. These namings are helpful and create
a distinction between each methods in the class.

Explaining the purpose : Decent

- Although the code is good from a readibility point of view, it may be difficult to understand from
an outsider point of view. 
- Comments could be added to provide extra clarity on how each Type Translation works.
- It would also be useful to get an idea of what is returned by the TypeTranslator class.

Additional Notes:

- I think the class overall, is very readable in terms of the context of what it does. 
- Adding some comments would have been useful to provide more information on what the methods do.
- Overall, the class scores well in terms of readiblity.
